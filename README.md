📂 **Multi-Source RAG System (Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

This project is a full-fledged **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** that can respond to user queries by leveraging multiple data sources such as **CSVs, PDFs, scanned images, and Wikipedia articles**. By combining advanced **data ingestion, preprocessing, semantic search, and large language model inference**, the system delivers accurate, context-rich answers for real-world business applications.

📎 **Example Use Case**

A data analyst uploads:

* a **customer churn CSV**,
* a **PDF report**,
* a set of **scanned contracts**,
* and a **Wikipedia topic** related to churn analysis.

The system ingests, processes, and indexes this multimodal data. When asked *“What factors contribute most to customer churn?”*, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks across all data sources, builds a context-rich prompt, and generates a **well-formed, evidence-based response** with 91% semantic similarity accuracy.
